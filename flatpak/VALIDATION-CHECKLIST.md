- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 4.5. Latency in Gaming Mode: **\_** (immediate / slight lag / noticeable delay) — compared to Desktop Mode: **\_** (same / worse / better)

### Gaming Mode Escalation Protocol (if black/white screen occurs)

If step 4.2 fails, try these in order. Document which (if any) resolves the issue:

1. [ ] Tried: `flatpak run --env=WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 com.ks0555.robotcontroller` — Result: **\_**
2. [ ] Tried: X11-only (`flatpak run --nosocket=wayland --socket=fallback-x11 com.ks0555.robotcontroller`) — Result: **\_**
3. [ ] Tried: Double env vars (both `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1` and `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`) — Result: **\_**
4. [ ] Captured: `flatpak run --command=env com.ks0555.robotcontroller` output — file: `validation-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-env.log`
5. [ ] Captured: `flatpak run --command=glxinfo com.ks0555.robotcontroller 2>&1` GPU info — file: **\_** (if glxinfo available)

Working combo (if found): **\_**

## 5. Steam Input Configuration (D-12, D-13)

- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 5.1. Steam Input ENABLED (default): gamepad events reach the app? (Yes / No)
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 5.2. Steam Input set to "Gamepad with Joystick Trackpad" template: gamepad events reach the app? (Yes / No)
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 5.3. Steam Input set to "Gamepad" (pass-through): gamepad events reach the app? (Yes / No)

**Recommended Steam Input template:** **\_** (document which template from 5.1-5.3 works best)

## 6. Round-Trip (D-14)

- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 6.1. Desktop Mode -> launch app -> works ✓
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 6.2. Switch to Gaming Mode -> launch app -> works ✓
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 6.3. Switch back to Desktop Mode -> launch app -> works ✓

## 7. Offline Mode (D-05)

- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 7.1. Launch app with BT24 powered OFF — StatusBar shows "Disconnected" or "Scanning..." (graceful, no crash)
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 7.2. Scan times out gracefully (no infinite spinner, no frozen UI)
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 7.3. ControlPad buttons are visible but non-functional (expected when no robot connected)

## 8. UI Validation (D-05)

- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 8.1. StatusBar shows correct states: Disconnected -> Scanning -> Connecting -> Connected
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 8.2. StatusBar re-shows "Disconnected" after robot powers off (BLE auto-disconnect)
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 8.3. ControlPad shows all 5 directional buttons (F, B, L, R, S) and they highlight on press
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 8.4. App window has correct title "Robot Controller" (not "Tauri App" or blank)
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 8.5. Window decorations and sizing work correctly in both Desktop and Gaming Mode

## 9. Edge Cases (D-15, D-16, D-17, D-18)

- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 9.1. `--device=input` finish-arg is honored (gamepad works) — if not, test `--device=all` fallback
  - Fallback needed? (Yes / No) — If yes, document Flatpak/SteamOS version: **\_**
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 9.2. BLE works in Gaming Mode (if BLE works in Desktop but not Gaming, document as known limitation per D-16)
  - Known limitation triggered? (Yes / No)
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 9.3. Flatpak install failure — if `flatpak install` fails, retry with `--verbose` and capture error: **\_**
  - Error resolved? (Yes / No) — Fix: **\_**
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 9.4. `flatpak run --command=env com.ks0555.robotcontroller` output includes `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1` (belt-and-suspenders env var is active in sandbox — D-10)
- [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL — 9.5. `flatpak run --env=RUST_LOG=debug com.ks0555.robotcontroller 2> validation-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-app.log` produces a log file with BLE connect, gamepad-direction events, and ble_send entries (embed key snippets in report per D-08/D-09)
