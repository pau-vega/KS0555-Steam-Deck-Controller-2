# Requirements: Steam Deck Robot Controller

**Defined:** 2026-05-03
**Core Value:** Control a real robot from Steam Deck gamepad input with low latency — commands must reach the robot reliably and quickly.

## v1 Requirements

### Monorepo Structure

- [ ] **MONO-01**: pnpm workspaces with apps/frontend and apps/backend directories
- [ ] **MONO-02**: Root package.json with dev scripts (`pnpm dev` runs both apps)
- [ ] **MONO-03**: TypeScript configured for both frontend and backend
- [ ] **MONO-04**: `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` work from root

### Backend
 
- [x] **BACK-01**: WebSocket server accepts frontend connections
- [x] **BACK-02**: Connects to DX-BT24 via serialport on `/dev/rfcomm0` at 9600 baud
- [ ] **BACK-03**: Forwards incoming WebSocket commands (F/B/L/R/S) to serial port
- [x] **BACK-04**: Auto-reconnects to serial port if connection drops
- [ ] **BACK-05**: Sends "S" (stop) command when WebSocket client disconnects
- [x] **BACK-06**: Logs received commands and serial connection status to console

### Frontend

- [x] **FRONT-01**: Displays connection status that updates when WebSocket connects/disconnects
- [x] **FRONT-02**: Manual buttons (F, B, L, R, S) send commands via WebSocket when clicked
- [x] **FRONT-03**: Last sent command is displayed on screen
- [x] **FRONT-04**: Gamepad stick input maps to correct robot commands with visible feedback
- [x] **FRONT-05**: Maps left analog stick to robot commands (up=F, down=B, left=L, right=R, neutral=S)
- [x] **FRONT-06**: Analog stick deadzone prevents jitter from triggering commands
- [x] **FRONT-07**: Commands only sent on direction change, not continuously
- [x] **FRONT-08**: WebSocket auto-reconnects if backend restarts

### Safety

- [ ] **SAFE-01**: Stop command sent when gamepad disconnects
- [ ] **SAFE-02**: Stop command sent when WebSocket connection drops

## v2 Requirements

### Motor Speed Control

- **MOTOR-01**: UI sliders for left/right motor speed
- **MOTOR-02**: Send u<number># and v<number># commands

### Connection Management

- **CONN-01**: Bluetooth device discovery and pairing from UI
- **CONN-02**: Connection history and diagnostics
- **CONN-03**: Configurable WebSocket server port

### Customization

- **CUST-01**: Customizable gamepad button/axis mapping
- **CUST-02**: Multiple robot profiles
- **CUST-03**: Adjustable deadzone threshold

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Authentication | Single-user local device, no security needed |
| Mobile app | Steam Deck Desktop Mode only for MVP |
| Cloud connectivity | Local control only, no internet dependency |
| Video feed | Adds complexity, not core to control |
| Autonomous/path planning | Manual control only for MVP |
| Tauri/Electron/Rust | Steam Deck Desktop Mode + browser is sufficient |
| Flatpak packaging | Run from source for MVP |

## Traceability
