## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. JS Files Cleanup
expected: Running `find apps/frontend/src -name '*.js'` returns zero results — all 13 JavaScript files have been deleted and replaced by their TypeScript equivalents.
result: issue
reported: "find apps/frontend/src -name '*.js' returns 13 .js files still present"
severity: major

### 2. Build Passes
expected: Running `pnpm build` completes successfully with zero errors. Frontend Vite build and backend build both succeed.
result: pass

### 3. Typecheck Passes
expected: Running `pnpm typecheck` completes with zero TypeScript errors across all workspaces (frontend, backend, packages).
result: pass

### 4. Lint Passes
expected: Running `pnpm lint` completes with zero ESLint errors. The react.js and node.js ESLint configs properly parse TypeScript files.
result: pass

### 5. All Tests Pass
expected: Running `pnpm test` passes with all 51 tests succeeding (39 frontend + 12 backend). No test failures.
result: pass

### 6. No `any` Types in Test Files
expected: Searching test files for `any` type usage returns zero results. All 21 previous `any` occurrences have been replaced with specific types.
result: pass

### 7. No TypeScript Suppressions
expected: No `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, or `@ts-expect-error` suppressions exist in the codebase. Zero `ignoreDeprecations` in tsconfig files.
result: pass

### 8. TS6059 Error Fixed
expected: Backend typecheck passes without TS6059 error. The vitest.config.ts file has been removed from backend tsconfig include array.
result: pass
