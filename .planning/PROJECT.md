# Steam Deck Robot Controller

## What This Is

A Tauri v2 desktop application for Steam Deck that connects the built-in gamepad to a Bluetooth Arduino robot (BT24 module). Provides a React UI with connection status and real-time gamepad-to-robot command mapping via native Rust backend (btleplug + gilrs).

## Core Value

Control a real robot from Steam Deck gamepad input with low latency — commands must reach the robot reliably and quickly through native Bluetooth LE and gamepad APIs.

## Current Milestone: v2.1 Flatpak Packaging

**Goal:** Replace AppImage distribution with a Flatpak bundle sideloaded onto Steam Deck, with sandbox permissions for BLE + gamepad and Gaming Mode integration.

**Target features:**
- Tauri v2 produces a `.deb` bundle (replaces AppImage in CI); deb is the intermediate artifact consumed by flatpak-builder (Phase 12) to produce the final Flatpak bundle
- Flatpak manifest with finish-args for BLE (`--system-talk-name=org.bluez`) and evdev/gamepad access
- CI builds signed `.flatpak` artifact; AppImage build removed from `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- Sideload install workflow documented for Steam Deck (`flatpak install --user app.flatpak`)
- "Add as Non-Steam Game" workflow for Gaming Mode launch
- Auto-update workflow (`flatpak update`) documented or scripted

## Previous Milestone: v2.0 Tauri Migration ✓

**Goal:** Migrate apps/frontend from browser-based React+Vite to a Tauri v2 desktop app, replacing broken Web Bluetooth and Gamepad APIs with native Rust alternatives.

**Shipped features:**
- Tauri v2 desktop shell with src-tauri Rust backend (Linux/SteamOS target)
- BLE communication via btleplug crate (replaces Web Bluetooth API)
- Gamepad input via gilrs crate (replaces navigator.getGamepads())
- Rewrite use-bluetooth.ts → Tauri invoke() + listen() for BLE commands
- Rewrite use-gamepad.ts → Tauri listen() for gamepad events
- Keep stable hook interfaces — app.tsx, control-pad.tsx, status-bar.tsx unchanged
- Tauri commands: ble_connect, ble_disconnect, ble_send
- Background threads emitting events: ble-state-changed, gamepad-direction, gamepad-connected, gamepad-disconnected

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces (apps/frontend, apps/backend) — Phase 1
- ✓ Backend WebSocket server accepts frontend connections — Phase 2
- ✓ Bluetooth serial bridge (DX-BT24 via serialport) — Phase 2
- ✓ React UI with connection status and manual control buttons — Phase 3
- ✓ Gamepad API integration with deadzone and direction-change guard — Phase 3
- ✓ WebSocket auto-reconnect — Phase 3
- ✓ Tauri v2 desktop shell with src-tauri Rust backend (Linux/SteamOS target) — Phase 6
- ✓ BLE communication via btleplug crate — Phase 7
- ✓ Gamepad input via gilrs crate — Phase 8
- ✓ Tauri commands: ble_connect, ble_disconnect, ble_send — Phase 7
- ✓ Background threads emitting events: ble-state-changed, gamepad-direction, gamepad-connected, gamepad-disconnected — Phases 7-8
- ✓ Rewrite use-bluetooth.ts → Tauri invoke() + listen() — Phase 9
- ✓ Rewrite use-gamepad.ts → Tauri listen() for gamepad events — Phase 9
- ✓ Stable hook interfaces preserved (app.tsx unchanged) — Phases 7-9

### Active

- [ ] Deb bundle feeds flatpak-builder; Flatpak bundle is the release artifact (Phases 12-15)
- [ ] Flatpak manifest with BLE (`org.bluez`) and gamepad/evdev finish-args
- [ ] Sideload install + "Add as Non-Steam Game" docs for Steam Deck Gaming Mode
- [ ] Auto-upgrade workflow (`flatpak update`) documented or scripted

### Validated

- ✓ Build and test on SteamOS target — Docker cross-compile via tauri-action — Phase 10
- ✓ Rust integration tests mocking btleplug/gilrs for event pipeline validation — Phase 10
- ✓ Switch tauri.conf.json bundle.targets to `["deb"]` with deb metadata — Phase 11 (PKG-01)
- ✓ Rewrite build.yml to single deb job with stock tauri-cli — Phase 11 (PKG-02, PKG-03)
- ✓ Delete build-steamdeck.sh, lock Flatpak runtime in PROJECT.md — Phase 11 (PKG-04)
- ✓ Legacy appimage test updated to deb target — Phase 11 (test fix)

### Out of Scope

- Motor speed control (u<number>#, v<number>#) — deferred, not needed for MVP
- Windows/macOS builds — Linux/SteamOS only
- Complex backend frameworks — minimal Rust Tauri only
- AppImage distribution — replaced by Flatpak in v2.1
- Flathub submission — sideload only for v2.1, may revisit later
- Self-hosted Flatpak repo — sideload only for v2.1
- Production-grade authentication — single-user local device
- apps/backend (Fastify + WebSocket) — replaced by Tauri Rust backend

## Context

- Target platform: Steam Deck (SteamOS Linux) running Tauri v2 desktop app
- Robot: Keyestudio Mini Tank Robot V3 with BT24 Bluetooth module (service UUID: 0000ffe0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb, characteristic UUID: 0000ffe1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb)
- Arduino firmware is FIXED and accepts: F, B, L, R, S, and optional motor speed commands
- Web Bluetooth API (navigator.bluetooth) does NOT work in Tauri's WebKitGTK on Linux/SteamOS
- Steam Input intercepts built-in gamepad before WebView gets it via navigator.getGamepads()
- Replace broken browser APIs with native Rust: btleplug (BLE) + gilrs (gamepad)
- Low latency is critical for responsive robot control
- Monorepo structure preserved: src-tauri lives inside apps/frontend/

## Constraints

- **Tech Stack**: Tauri v2 + React + Vite + TypeScript frontend, Rust (edition 2021) backend with btleplug + gilrs
- **Platform**: Steam Deck (SteamOS Linux) — Tauri deb target (via flatpak-builder for final bundle), no Windows/macOS builds
- **Robot Firmware**: Cannot modify Arduino code — must work with existing BT24 UART serial protocol (F, B, L, R, S commands)
- **Bluetooth**: BT24 device — btleplug crate, service UUID 0000ffe0, characteristic UUID 0000ffe1, device name filter "BT24"
- **Gamepad**: gilrs crate, deadzone 0.15, prefer Steam Deck controller (id contains "Steam"), same axis logic as current use-gamepad.ts
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces mandatory — src-tauri lives inside apps/frontend/
- **Hook Interfaces**: use-bluetooth.ts and use-gamepad.ts must keep same return shape — app.tsx, control-pad.tsx, status-bar.tsx must be unchanged
- **No new UI components** — only infrastructure changes

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Tauri v2 over v1 | v2 is current stable, better SteamOS support | ✓ Implemented Phase 6 |
| btleplug for BLE | Cross-platform Rust BLE crate, works on Linux/SteamOS | ✓ Implemented Phase 7 |
| gilrs for gamepad | Rust gamepad library, sees Steam Deck built-in controller | ✓ Implemented Phase 8 |
| Replace Web Bluetooth API | WebKitGTK on SteamOS blocks navigator.bluetooth | ✓ Done Phase 7 (Rust) + Phase 9 (hooks) |
| Replace Gamepad API | Steam Input intercepts before WebView gets it | ✓ Done Phase 8 (Rust) + Phase 9 (hooks) |
| Keep hook return shapes stable | app.tsx, control-pad.tsx, status-bar.tsx must be unchanged | ✓ Verified Phase 9 |
| Monorepo preserved | src-tauri lives inside apps/frontend/, pnpm for packages | ✓ Implemented Phase 6 |
| Deprecate apps/backend | Fastify + WebSocket no longer needed, Tauri Rust backend replaces it | ✓ Deprecated Phase 6 |
| Switch from AppImage to deb (Flatpak input) | Better SteamOS integration via Flatpak; deb is the intermediate artifact for flatpak-builder | ✓ Implemented Phase 11 |
| Flatpak runtime choice | `org.freedesktop.Platform//24.08` with SDK `24.08` and GL extension — smaller, no GNOME deps, ships WebKitGTK for Tauri v2 | ✓ Phase 11 (PKG-04) |
| Sideload-only distribution | No Flathub overhead, single-user device, faster iteration | Pending v2.1 |
| Flatpak runtime | `org.freedesktop.Platform//24.08` with SDK `org.freedesktop.Sdk//24.08` | Smaller (~300 MB), no GNOME deps, ships WebKitGTK-6 for Tauri v2. Extension: `org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.default` for GPU rendering. EOL Aug 2027. | Phase 11 |
