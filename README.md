# KS0555 Steam Deck Robot Controller

Drive a Bluetooth Arduino robot (DX-BT24 module) with your Steam Deck gamepad.
Single Tauri v2 desktop app — Rust talks BLE directly via `btleplug`, gamepad
via `gilrs`. No separate backend, no `rfcomm`, no Chrome flags.

## Install on Steam Deck

In **Desktop Mode**, open Konsole and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pau-vega/KS0555-Steam-Deck-Controller-2/main/install-on-steamdeck.sh | bash
```

That:

1. Downloads the latest signed AppImage from GitHub Releases.
2. Drops it in `~/Applications/RobotController.AppImage` and makes it executable.
3. Registers a `.desktop` entry so it shows up in Steam's *Add a Non-Steam Game* picker.

Final manual step: in Steam → Library → **+** → **Add a Non-Steam Game** →
pick **Robot Controller** → *Add Selected Programs*. Switch to Gaming Mode
and it lives under the Non-Steam tab. Re-run the curl line any time to upgrade.

### Manual install (no script)

If you'd rather not pipe to bash:

1. Grab the AppImage matching your CPU from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/pau-vega/KS0555-Steam-Deck-Controller-2/releases/latest)
   (Steam Deck = `x86_64`).
2. `chmod +x ~/Downloads/RobotController-x86_64.AppImage`.
3. Steam → Library → **+** → **Add a Non-Steam Game** → *Browse* → pick the AppImage.

## Develop on Mac

The same Tauri app runs on macOS — `btleplug` uses CoreBluetooth, `gilrs` uses IOKit.
You can iterate on the Mac and only boot the Deck when you need on-device verification.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @ks0555/frontend tauri:dev
```

First time you press *Connect Bluetooth*, macOS prompts for Bluetooth access — driven
by `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` in `apps/frontend/src-tauri/Info.plist`. Allow it once.

To produce a local `.app` / `.dmg`:

```bash
pnpm --filter @ks0555/frontend tauri:build
# Output: apps/frontend/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/{macos,dmg}/
```

The macOS bundle is unsigned — Gatekeeper will warn on first launch. Right-click → *Open* once to whitelist it.

## Architecture

```
React (Vite)  ──Tauri IPC──>  Rust (btleplug + gilrs)  ──BLE──>  BT24  ──UART──>  Arduino
```

One process, one binary. The Rust side owns the BLE peripheral handle and
the gamepad event loop; the React side just `invoke()`s commands and `listen()`s
for state events.

## Commands

The Arduino sketch accepts these single-character commands over the BT24 serial line:

| Command | Action          |
|---------|-----------------|
| `F`     | Move forward    |
| `B`     | Move backward   |
| `L`     | Turn left       |
| `R`     | Turn right      |
| `S`     | Stop            |

## Gamepad Mapping

| Input              | Command |
|--------------------|---------|
| Left stick up      | `F`     |
| Left stick down    | `B`     |
| Left stick left    | `L`     |
| Left stick right   | `R`     |
| Stick at neutral   | `S`     |

Left-stick deadzone is 0.15 (defined in
`apps/frontend/src-tauri/src/gamepad/mod.rs`).

## Build from source

Prereqs: Node ≥ 18 (`.nvmrc` pins exact version), pnpm ≥ 10, Rust stable.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @ks0555/frontend tauri:build  # macOS / Linux dev box
./build-steamdeck.sh                        # SteamOS / Arch self-build (optional)
```

`build-steamdeck.sh` exists for offline / on-device source builds — usually you don't need it; the GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/build.yml` produces the AppImage attached to each tagged release.
